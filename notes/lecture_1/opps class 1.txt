what is the difference between class & object?
 class is a design which defines what an object looks like, what an object can do, for what an object is for
class don't occupy memory when it is created

class 
public/private/protected class name {
 	class property
	class method
	class object
}

object is the actual thing defined inside class 
it triggers when system creates a new object and also occupy memory
new objectname();

important pillers

Encapsulation-Keeping data safe inside the object. Only the object can change its own internals. A remote control: You press ""Volume Up (Public), but you don't touch the circuit board (Private).

Inheritance-Creating a new class based on an existing one to reuse code A Sports Car is a type of Car It gets all the Car features for free but adds Turbo.

Polymorphism, Different objects can respond to the same command in their own way. You tell a Dog and a Cat to Speak. The Dog barks, the Cat meows. Same command, different result.

Abstraction, Hiding complex logic behind a simple interface. You don't need to know how an internal combustion engine works to drive a car; you just use the pedals.

why oops?

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.


how to define a class?

class class name {

	//code
}


<?php
class car {
//properties

 public $name;
 public $model:

//function/method
 function setname($name) {
	$this->name = $name;
}

function setmodel($model) {
	$this->model = $model;
}



function getname($name) {
	return $this->name ;
}

function getmodel($model) {
	return $this->model;
}


//object
$dzire = new car();
$wegonR = new car();

$desire->setmodel('2015');
$wegonR->setmodel('2024');

echo $weonR-.getmodel();

}
?>


<?php

class College
{
    public $qualification;
    public $age;

    function setQualification($qualification)
    {
        $this->qualification = $qualification;
    }

    function setAge($age)
    {
        $this->age = $age;
    }

    function getQualification()
    {
        return $this->qualification;
    }

  
    function getAge()
    {
        return $this->age;
    }
}

$B_tech = new College();
$M_tech = new College();


$B_tech->setQualification("B.Tech");
$B_tech->setAge(23);

$M_tech->setQualification("M.Tech");
$M_tech->setAge(26);


echo $B_tech->getQualification() . " - Age: " . $B_tech->getAge();
echo "<br>";
echo $M_tech->getQualification() . " - Age: " . $M_tech->getAge();
